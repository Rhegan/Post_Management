This guide will walk you through the steps required to install and set up a Laravel project using Inertia and React for CRUD status posts.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- PHP 8.2.12
- Composer
- Node.js 20.10.0 and npm
- MySQL or any other preferred database

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Rhegan/Post_Management.git
    cd Post_Management
    ```

2. **Install PHP dependencies**

    ```sh
    composer install
    ```

3. **Install Node.js dependencies**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4. **Copy .env file**

    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5. **Generate application key**

    ```sh
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

6. **Configure your environment variables**

    Open the `.env` file and update the necessary configuration for your database and other services:

    ```dotenv
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=your_database_name

    Your application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Additional Commands
